# Predicting-Cab-booking-cancellations
## [Project 3: Predicting	Customer	Cancellation	of	Cab	Bookings	for	YourCabs.com](https://github.com/psharma0912/Predicting-Cab-booking-cancellations.git)

YourCabs	 is	 a	 Bangalore-based	 technology	 platform	 that	manages	real-time	supply	and	demand	of	cabs.	In	this	project	we	
will	try	to	predict	possible	cancellations	of	cab	booking	by	the	customer	using	data	obtained	 from	the	
company.	Our goal	is	to	reduce	the	cost	incurred	by	the	company	as	a	result	of	cab cancellations	made	
by	the	customer.	By	predicting	possible	cancellations	an	hour	before the	pickup	time,	YourCabs	will be
better	 able	 to manage	 its	 vendors	 and	 drivers	 by	 providing	 them	 with	 up	 to	 date	 information	 about	
customer	cancellations and	reduce	the	cost incurred	from sending	a	cab	to	a	booking location	that has	
been	cancelled	by	the	customer.
